This post is our new edition of Three.js News. In this episode we will be amazed by cinematographic experiences and awesome effects. Some of them will even give you goosebumps or make your hairs stand on end. We will explore physics engines, blockbuster movies coming soon, particles, portfolios. We will take a look at everything from a manga universe to a world of change. There is also a show off, a very special mention to a great experience that we found, combining 3d animation, motion capture and projection. These vivid experiences are unforgettable and all too real.

### Cardboard With Oimo 
![cardboard_with_oimo](/data/2015-06-29-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-6-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/cardboard_with_oimo.jpg)

This is a very fun and colourful [demo](http://puga.com.br/play/cardboard-oimo/) created by [Marcio Puga](https://twitter.com/marciopuga) using oimo.js. [Oimo](http://lo-th.github.io/Oimo.js/) is a great physics engine developed by lo-th. In this demo you can see how the spheres change color and react when they touch each other and the surface around them. It's very cool and you also have a view for google cardboard. 

### Insidious movie experience 
![insidious_movie_experience](/data/2015-06-29-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-6-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/insidious_movie_experience.jpg)

This awesome cinematographic [experience](http://www.insidious-movie.net/entertheroom/) will make your hairs stand on end. The first two episodes of the Insidious movie saga really frightened me. I'm anxiously waiting for the new one. This demo is not reassuring. I think i'm gonna be even more scared! You explore the room around you and click on the hot spots, the story will develop with each click. The effects will have you screaming your heart out! 

### 1 Million Particles
![1million_particles](/data/2015-06-29-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-6-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/1million_particles.jpg)

This [demo](http://codepen.io/edankwan/pen/QbMxWp) shows us a beautiful and subtile way of creating particles in codepen.io. Developed by [Edan Kwan](https://twitter.com/edankwan) using curl noise and fbo on three.js. He produced a very professional and fascinating effect. You can change the color of the particles, the size, the speed. 

### Aaron Meyers portfolio

In his [portfolio](http://aaron-meyers.com/!/) [Aaron Meyers](https://twitter.com/aarontweets) creates a very cool environment. We can see his skills as a developer in this original homepage.Turn around in the room and by clicking on each TV screen you can explore the works he has done. You can also click on Aaron himself to know a bit more about him. This is hands down one of the most creative portfolios I have seen.  

### Realize project 
![realize_project](/data/2015-06-29-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-6-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/realize_project.jpg)

If you liked the movie Ghost in the Shell you are going to love this [project](http://www.realize-project.jp/) It is an homage made by true fans. [Ghost in the Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell) is a manga by Masamune Shirow, there was also a movie made of it. This demo captures the universe of the manga pretty well. You can turn around and decide which icon to pop-up. There are very cool neon lights in the space, it gives it kind of a Tron aspect. You can also take a look at posts on VR and AI from other news-based sites. 

### A world of change 
![a_world_of_change](/data/2015-06-29-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-6-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/a_world_of_change.jpg)

This [demo](http://news-lab-trends-experiment.appspot.com/) is part of [Google Trends](https://www.google.com/trends/). It is a great idea for social impact. Through google search you can click on topic (recycling, energy, water, natural environment, pollution) or a city, and see how those searches reflect the way the world thinks about climate change. You can discover what certain cities are doing about the environment. It is an eye opener and a great way to encourage sustainable development

### Terminator Genisys 
![terminator_genisys](/data/2015-06-29-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-6-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/terminator_genisys.jpg)

[Terminator Genisys](http://www.terminatorgenisysmovie.co.uk/insidelook/) is another successful and  cinema based demo created my [Paramount Pictures](https://twitter.com/ParamountUK). You can get an amazing inside of the characters by rotating the camera to explore 3d models. You can also zoom in and click on hotspots for information and videos about the movie coming soon. It is very fun.

### Show Off "Le Petit Chef"
![le_petit_chef](/data/2015-06-29-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-6-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/le_petit_chef.jpg)

Special mention to this great experience that we found. [Le Petit Chef](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBJEP4lsRFY&feature=youtu.be) is a masterpiece created by the guys at [Skull Mapping](http://www.skullmapping.com/), [Filip Sterckx](http://www.filipsterckx.be/) and [Antoon Verbeek](http://www.antoon.be/). They experimented with projection on a dinner table. Combining 3d animation and motion capture, a miniature chef turns your dish into a grill and cooks right in front of your astonished eyes. I wish I could book a place at this table! It is an awesome experience that I'm sure you will love. 

## Conclusion 
In this episode of Three.js News we have seen awesome projects. All very vivid and lifelike. Some movie related and some really scary, others more realistic and down to protecting earth. They all have their own universe. We experienced physics and particles, projection and motion capture. Regardless of how or by whom they were developed, all these experiences show us what is possible to create in the amazing universe of 3D.
