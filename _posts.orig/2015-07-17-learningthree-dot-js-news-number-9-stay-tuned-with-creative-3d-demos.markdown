This post is part of the Three.js News series. If you have a taste for innovation and digital creativity in 3D, this series is for you. For this edition we have collected some very artistic demos. We will take a look at some unique projects. Everything from subversive and divergent experiences to particle libraries has a place in this post. We will play around with funny and endearing characters and explore objects around Earth's orbit. We will spin around colorful cities and visit impressive one man portfolio. All of these developers are taking creativity one step further.

### Like to Death 
![like_to_death](/data/2015-07-17-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-9-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/like_to_death.jpg)

This [demo](http://www.liketodeath.com/) is a subversively intelligent project to show us the sometimes empty shell of social media 'likes'. It was created by [Geoffrey Lillemon](http://www.geoffreylillemon.com/website/) and [Stööki](http://www.stooki.co.uk/), an independent design collective. How many times a day do we "like" something on the web? These clicks have a lot of power over us. In the demo you can see the figure of death and her demons on the middle. As more and more people like the project, it will get destroyed. Our "likes" will totally disintegrate the scene. 

### Particulate.js

[Particulate.js](http://particulatejs.org/) is a JavaScript particle physics micro library. Developed by [Jay Weeks](https://twitter.com/jpweeks/), it is simple, fast and stable. The movement of the particles is amazing, you can see them flowing in and out and control them with your mouse. They come together in a compact cloud of matter. 

### Sneeze the Dragon

This creative, fun and very interactive [demo](http://codepen.io/Yakudoo/pen/yNjRRL) was created by [Yakudoo](https://twitter.com/yakudoo) on Codepen.io. Yakudoo is a very talented developer who truly has a gift when it comes to imagining fun demos like this one. The more you keep clicking the harder the dragon sneezes, be careful, that's fire he is breathing out! 

### Blend4Web Player

You can turn this funny Yoda like character around and look at the awesome shadows the model casts. Visit the Blend4Web [website](https://www.blend4web.com/en/) to see all their different demos and designs.

[Stuff in Space](http://stuffin.space/) is a sideral demo created by [James Yoder](https://github.com/jeyoder). It is a realtime 3d map of objects that are in Earth's orbit. You can explore  all the waves and transmissions surrounding our planet. The website updates daily with data from [space track](https://www.space-track.org/auth/login) and uses [satellite.js](https://github.com/shashwatak/satellite-js) a cool Javascript library to calculate satellite positions. 

### Circular City 
![circular_city](/data/2015-07-17-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-9-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/circular_city.jpg)

This interactive [demo](http://codepen.io/Mombasa/pen/NqMMLX/) was developed by [Mombasa](http://codepen.io/Mombasa/) on Codepen.io. You can follow the movement of  a very colourful and revolving city. Nice way to build it using three.js You can see the streets and buildings closer to you as it moves around and uncovers itself. [Codepen.io](http://codepen.io/) is a code editor in your browser, excellent for designers and developers to create wonderful projects. 

### Conclusion 
In this episode of the Three.js News series we saw demos bursting with artistic innovation and creativity. All developers featured here are true artists of the digital and 3D world. Their characters are memorable. Their ideas and profiles are designed to make a lasting impression in our minds. Their creations are aesthetic, useful, inspirational, filled with knowledge and skill. I hope you appreciate and enjoy their talents. 

Stay tuned for more Three.js News. See you next time
