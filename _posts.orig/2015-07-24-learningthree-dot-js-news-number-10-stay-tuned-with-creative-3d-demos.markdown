This post is about the 10th episode of Three.js News. We are very happy to share exceptional demos with you every week. In all the 3D experiences we have shared on previous episodes, we have witnessed talent, dedication and skill. Without so many creative projects we wouldn't have been able to continue with the news. So, to celebrate this 10th edition, we are going to travel through space, time and even dimensions. 

In this episode, we will explore other worlds and make musical journeys across decades and light years. We will wonder around the Parisian metro in a different light and be amazed by the simple beauty of land and stone. We will interact with the futuristic and be repelled by the terrestrial. We will learn to safeguard and preserve our cultural heritage through online 3D, and finally, take a walk through the magical woods of the imagination.

It is a Webgl data visualisation experience. It gives commuters information about the metro system, like journey times and people touching in at each station. It is dynamic and interactive. [Dataveyes' mission](http://dataveyes.com/?em_x=22#!/en) is to transform human data into the best user experiences.

It will truly make you loose your appetite. It is a realistic and big slimy worm crawling on your screen. The texture is very cool and life-like. The slithering creature is in the form of a torus knot which makes it even more disturbing when it moves!  

### Future Citizen

This [demo](http://ftrctzn.com/) is a funky presentation of Future citizen, a studio making interactive web experiences for brands. It is creative and hypnotic. You can see the net of waves flow towards and against the letters. If you move your mouse around to trigger the effect, you will see that the interactions are pretty neat.

In this demo we can see the amounts of space trash that have been produced by space travel. The idea is to track some of that trash in real time. The red dots are points where the debris fly past each other at close range. In the bottom left we can fast forward to see all the potential future collisions of trash around Earth.

[Red Stone](http://potemkin.se/redstone/) is a beautifully polished demo made with [Goo Create](http://goocreate.com/). It was done by [Magnus Östergren](https://twitter.com/herrpotemkin), their creative director. The scene is like a desert with some subtle wildlife on it. It has wonderful lighting and shadow casting moving around the stone. It was made with an iphone 6. This is just an example of the cool things you can do with the Goo Create tool.

### Conclusion

In this episode we travelled far far away, through some exceptional worlds. We experienced fashion extravaganza and music playing in distant light years from Earth. Our journey took us from underground Paris to primitive and futuristic worlds. We explored possible collisions and beautiful life-like scenes. We also protected our cultural heritage and discovered, in the woods, a magical way to go.
