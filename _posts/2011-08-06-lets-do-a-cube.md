title: Lets Do a Cube
categories: [basic, webgl]
---

Here is the first lesson! I started with something real simple, a **cube**.
I wasnt sure how to present the lesson, so i did
an [annotated source of the example](/data/lets_do_a_cube/docs/lets_do_a_cube.html)
to get things started.
I kept it small as possible to simplicity sake.
It is only 70 lines of javascript for a *webgl simplistic demo*. I hope it shows that webgl
is quite accessible.

You can see this [example live](/data/lets_do_a_cube/lets_do_a_cube.html) or in the
screencast below.
