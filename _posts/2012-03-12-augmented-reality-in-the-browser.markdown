This post is about augmented reality in the browser.
In a recent post, we saw that it is now possible to
[have live video in webgl](/blog/2012/02/07/live-video-in-webgl/)
with
[WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org/).
Due to this,
[augmented reality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality)
is under the spotlight. Recently
[html5rock](http://www.html5rocks.com/) published a
tutorial
by
[ilmari heikkinen](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/profiles/#ilmari)
about
"[writting augmented reality application using jsartoolkit](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webgl/jsartoolkit_webrtc/)".
Ilmari is
[google devrel for webgl](https://plus.google.com/115293744081058969329/about)
and the author of
[JSARToolKit](http://github.com/kig/JSARToolKit)
too. So we are in good hands :)
The tutorial even include a part about binding it with
[three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/).
I took this nice tutorial and packaged the code even easier to reuse.

[Try this demo](http://jeromeetienne.github.com/tquery.jsartoolkit/).
If you got [WebRTC is available](http://www.webrtc.org/running-the-demos) in your browser, take
[this marker](http://jeromeetienne.github.com/tquery.jsartoolkit/marker/marker.png),
and put it in front on your webcam. 
It is the same you see on the right.
It is best to print it on paper.
If you can't, point your phone to
[this page](http://jeromeetienne.github.com/tquery.jsartoolkit/marker) instead.
Phone screens tend to reflect lights from your environment tho. They may
reduce the accuracy of the marker detection.

Now let's see how you can to use all this to build your own demos :)

## You Include it

First you include it as usual in your page. The code is available
[here](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/tquery.jsartoolkit).
Note that
[JSARToolKit](http://github.com/kig/JSARToolKit)
is released under GPL, so some restrictions apply.
The threex is under MIT license as usual.

```html
    <script src="JSARToolKit.js"></script>
    <script src="threex.jsartoolkit.js"></script>
```

## You Initialize It

Once you get the code, you instanciate the object like this.

```javascript
	var threexAR	= new THREEx.JSARToolKit({
		srcElement	: srcElement,
		threshold	: threshold,
		callback	: function(event){}
	});
```

The ```srcElement``` may be a
[video](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_video), an
[image](http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/objects.html#h-13.2)
or a
[canvas](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/the-canvas-element.html).
When the video is shoot in a uncontrolled environement,
the marker detection may be less reliable, due to variations of lighting.
 ```threshold``` is a value between 0 and 255 to adapt your detection to those variations. 
To detect the augmented reality markers in the ```srcElement```, just use this line in your
rendering loop.

```javascript
    threexAR.update();
```

No rocket science here.

## You Use It

During ```.update()```, the callback is notified with events.
They describe the markers present on the srcElement. 
Each event got various fields:
A ```.markerId``` which tell you which marker has been recognized.
The
[one used above](http://jeromeetienne.github.com/tquery.jsartoolkit/marker)
is the *64*. You can find the whole list
[in JSARToolKit repository](https://github.com/kig/JSARToolKit/tree/master/demos/markers).

The ```.type``` field describe what is happening to this marker.
It may be *create*, *update* or *delete*.
*create* if the marker has just been detected,
*update* if the marker was present before.
and *delete* if the marker is no more present.
Rather obvious :)
The ```.matrix``` field is a
[THREE.Matrix4](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/src/core/Matrix4.js).
It is a transform which matches the position of the marker in space.

## Conclusion

So now we can do augmented reality in a browser.
The code of the demo is [here](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/tquery.jsartoolkit).
Up to us to find actual application of this technology.
Currently most browsers with webcam are running on desktop/laptop tho.
As most their webcam is directly attached to screens, It limits the flexibility of
what you could put on front of the camera.
As for mobile, only opera 12 is currently the only mobile browser able
to read the webcam.

That's all folks. Have fun :)
