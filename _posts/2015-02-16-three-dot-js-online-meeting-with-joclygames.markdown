Hello everybody. 

This is a new Three.js Online Meeting post. The idea is to interview people using [Three.js](http://threejs.org/) in their projects. I think it is a great way to learn from each other and share our experiences.  You know me, I love three.js and I love talking about it. In this video of about 1 hour you are gonna see some interesting people really passionate about games and three.js

For this interview, i talked with 
[Jérôme CHOAIN](https://twitter.com/jcfrog) and 
[Michel Gutierrez](https://twitter.com/_mig_)
, the guys behind [Jocly Games](https://www.jocly.com). 
They have over 113 web board games with very cool features as you will see.  You can play on and off line with your friends, or just you and your computer. They also have some mobile apps that make their games even more accessible. You can dowload their games from [Facebook](https://apps.facebook.com/joclyfb/), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Jocly) and [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/aclap/id512525676). And good news for developers: you can create and embed your own games! It is tons of fun. Be sure to check it out.
