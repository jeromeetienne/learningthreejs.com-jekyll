[Poonya](http://community.poonya.com/156) is an active community and a cool portal for sharing assets. That is, you will be able to share models, material, textures, animations and scripts with [SEA3D](https://twitter.com/sea3dformat ) Studio for web. An easy to use editor that allows you to create models and to share them with others. You have a wide range of tutorials to help you get started and discover all the functionalities. You can also take a look at all the projects, contributions from other developers. 

### Chill de lion

Beautiful [demo](http://codepen.io/Yakudoo/pen/YXxmYR?utm_content=buffer71fab&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) created by [Yakudoo](https://twitter.com/yakudoo). We saw paranoid birds in another three.js news. Now its time for the king of the jungle. You will see a very cute animation of a lion who is in desperate need of chillin' and refreshment. It must be a very warm summer day for him. By clicking you activate the ventilation and  when turning around with your mouse you make wind blow in every direction. The lion will definitely appreciate. He will actually smile.

### Holy Running Cow

This is another [demo](http://codepen.io/Yakudoo/pen/rVGraP) done by Yakudoo. He really has a talent for creating fun animal characters! You can see  a very cute cow running around. When you press and drag the scene rotates, and the cow tries to pick up the pace. 

### Mighty Fish

We just love Yakudoo's demos. This one is called [Mighty Fish](http://codepen.io/Yakudoo/pen/BNNGBq). In it you will see a very determined fish, swimming with or against the current. Kind of Nemo's father when he couldn't find Nemo. You can move your mouse to change speed and direction and see how adorably funny it is. 

### Many Icons Using Three.js 
![screen shot 2015-07-03 at 11 42 27](/data/2015-07-03-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-7-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/many_icons_using_threejs.jpg)

Funky [demo](http://codepen.io/clockmaker/details/gpozrX/) created by Yasunobu Ikeda in [codepen.io](http://codepen.io/clockmaker/). It shows various icons and letters that come together and turn into one, flowing in a replaying cycle. It changes color every time and it sometimes gives you the impression of being inside the Matrix. This demo was created using the Time Remap effect with Three.js and TweenMax. You can visit the Clock Maker [website](http://clockmaker.jp/labs/) to see all Yasunobu's experiences in this interactive motion lab. 

### Unstable Clock 
![screen shot 2015-07-03 at 11 42 51](/data/2015-07-03-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-7-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/unstable_clock.jpg)

This one is a captivating [demo]( http://freelance-html-developer.com/clock/) and a Chrome Experiment developed by [Tomasz Slawnikowski](http://freelance-html-developer.com/), a freelance html developer. It measures time in an original frame. Every second is drawn according to the hour passing by. If you look a it for a while you will feel in a state of unreality, in a haze, hypnotic state. Even if it appears unstable, the clock is ticking! 

### Crazy Skills 
![screen shot 2015-07-03 at 11 43 42](/data/2015-07-03-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-7-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/crazy_skills.jpg)

[Crazy Skills](https://crazyskills.panasonic.com/en/) is a very cool project created by [Panasonic](@panasonic_njr). If you are a football fan you are definitely gonna enjoy it. It is an awesome presentation of football player [Neymar](@neymarjr) incredible sport skills. Just in case you don't know him, Neymar is a recognised and adored Brazilian football player who plays for FC Barcelona and is captain of the Brazilian national team. He is very talented as you can see it in this motion museum dedicated to him.  There a a set of skills you can click on and see how Neymar's avatar plays on the field. 

### Fiddling with shaders 
![screen shot 2015-07-03 at 11 48 33](/data/2015-07-03-learningthree-dot-js-news-number-7-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/screenshots/fiddling_with_shaders.jpg)

Very kaleidoscopic [experiment](http://chrisirhc.github.io/_experiment-sand-webgl/push-field.html) created by [Chris Chua](https://twitter.com/chrisirhc). In this demo Chris plays around with shaders in WebGL to simulate force over an area. You can click and drag your mouse around to see how a trail is designed, go faster or slower. It almost resembles a small fish in the water. 

### I'll be back

Amazing [project](https://c1.goote.ch/b9cca08d92a744e79a6772e13d624200.scene/) brought to us by the team at [Goo Create](https://twitter.com/GooTechnologies). Here is another cinematic and life like demo inspired by the last Terminator film. The effects and sound intensify the experience and the ambiance around is purely immersive. On their [website](http://goocreate.com/) you can try out their great WebGL creation tool for ads, games and interactive experiences. Their editor is impressive by its simplicity and accessibility. 

### Conclusion
In this episode of Three.js News we discovered some great ways to create 3D models and share assets. There are vast possibilities when using great editors and tools. We discovered letters and numbers that form together in time and space. We also played with fun and lovable characters and professional football skills. We hope that you will really enjoy experimenting with all these projects. 

Stay tuned for more Three.js News. See you next time
