Hello everybody, 

This post is a special edition of Three.js News. We have decided to change the format a bit. We will continue publishing the most interesting and creative 3D demos on the web. We will collect the ones that we have tweeted during the week and highlight each one. It's more of a Newsletter kind of style. Hope you like it :) 

### Icosahedron Snake
