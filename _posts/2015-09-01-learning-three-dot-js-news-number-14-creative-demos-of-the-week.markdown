Hello everybody!

This post is about edition 14 of Three.js News. Our favorite demos of last week were very fun to play around with. There were some set above the clouds, staring directly at the sun. Some were cool webgl experiences inspired by games and movies. Some showed a brilliant use of shaders and VR technology. And we even met a three.js sock puppet!
